	<h2><em>Programmed Projects</em></h2>

	<p class="header"><em>Administrative App</em></p>
	<div class="indent">
		<p>Purpose: For the BringMe Delivery team</p>
		<p>Overview: This app software was made to track all the orders placed by app users; displaying where/when the order was made, when/where they were delivered, etc. It was supposed to be used to expand the company's delivery "bubble" and see where there can be improvement, but the company went in a different direction.</p>
		<p>This project was very Javascript heavy, with multiple controllers being used. We also programmed the backend using C#, and even did the SQL DB work - but I had less to do with that.</p>
		<p>This project uses Angular and Ionic frameworks, as well as package managers and organizers such as Bower, Yeoman, and Gulp.</p>
		<p>Due to company protocol, I couldn't put the exact project online, but I've recreated the functionalities (without user data) and it can be found on my Github account under the "AdminApp" repository.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="header"><em>My Portfolio -- this website!</em></p>
	<div class="indent">
		<p>Purpose: To display my work</p>
		<p>Overview: The is just a simple website intended to allow potential employers to understand what kind of work I've already done.</p>
		<p>This website was made using only sublime. I made it very simple, all using only HTML and CSS. It's the first project I've ever done outside of a typical IDE.<br>I feel that a lot of times developers can get lost in all the new technologies (wireframes, libraries, etc) so I made this website using nothing. That being said, I don't ever want to do it again. GIVE ME BOOTSTRAP BACK.</p>
		<p>The code can be found on my Github account under the "MySite" repository.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="header"><em>Image App</em></p>
	<div class="indent">
		<p>Purpose: To learn/for fun</p>
		<p>Overview: It was essentially supposed to be an Instagram on a map. You can login and post photos that are attached to a location, or view all photos on a map without logging in.</p>
		<p>Other than the basic HTML, and JavaScript on the page, I've used Google Maps APIs as well as a FireBase backend to deal with saving users and verifying logins.</p>
		<p>This project also uses Angular and Ionic frameworks, as well as package managers and organizers such as Bower, Yeoman, and Gulp.</p>
		<p>Can be found on my Github account under the "MyMap" repository.</p>

	<h2><em>Designs</em></h2>

	<p class="header"><em>Client Site</em></p>
	<div class="indent">
		<p>Purpose: This is a friend's website for their photography. I didn't have anything to do with the code (I believe he used squarespace) but designed what it should look like in order to accurately refelct his work and personality.</p>
		<img id="mlrb" src="MLRBsc.png">
		<p>It was meant to be clean & simple to allow the vibrant colors of his own photography take the attention of the user.</p>
		<p>His contact information is available upon request.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="header"><em>Mood Boards</em></p>
	<div class="indent">
		<p>Purpose: These are my own creations (powered by Tumblr) that I like to put together based on color schemes and just overall moods.</p>
		<img class="moodBoardz" src="TumblrChalky.png">
		<img class="moodBoardz" src="TumblrCool.png">
		<p id="start">Through creating boards like these, I get inspirations for potential "feels" of website pages.</p>
